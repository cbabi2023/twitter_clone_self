# twitter_clone

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
### Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


- Add new tasks with information like a title, description, and priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- View a list of tasks and sort them by priority.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending, with an option to view only completed or only pending tasks.
- Save tasks locally on the device, so the data stays available even if the app is closed.
